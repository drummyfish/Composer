    <h2 id="basic_file_structure" > Basic file structure </h2>

    <p>
      The coposition description is a text file format. It consists of
      two main sections:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        section definitions - Describes various section that are later
        used to form compositions. A section is a part of a composition,
        such as rock chorus, pop verse etc.
      </li>
      <li>
        structure definition - Describes various music genre composition
        structures using previously defined sections with regular
        expression-like strings.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      The basic file structure is therefore:
    </p>

    <p class="code">
      sections: <br />
      <span class="descriptive"> section definitions </span> <br />
      structures: <br />
      <span class="descriptive"> structure definitions </span> <br />
    </p>

    <h2 id="comments"> Comments </h2>

    <p>
      Any text beginning with '#' up to the end of line is considered
      a comment and is not processed.
    </p>

    <h2 id="section_definitions"> Section definitions </h2>

    <p>
      Sections describe a part of a composition, such as rock chorus,
      metal bridge, pop verse, rock intro etc. They use name-value
      pair to give the composer program hints on how the section
      should be composed. Note that all of these parameters are just
      hint and may not always be fully satisfied.
    </p>

    <p>
      A section structure in the file is:
    </p>

    <p class="code">
    <span class="descriptive"> section_name </span> : <br />
    { <br />
    <span class="descriptive"> parameter_name </span> :
    <span class="descriptive"> parameter_value </span> <br />
    <span class="descriptive"> ... </span> <br />
    } <br />
    </p>

    <p>
      Any name-value pairs can be given, as they are just hints and will
      be ignored if the composer program doesn't understand them (in
      which case, however, it should let the user know about any
      name-value pair it didn't understand). The name-pair values must
      be separated by newlines.
    </p>

    <h3 id="parameter_values"> Parameter values </h3>

    <p>
      Parameter values are of string data type. Due to the fact that
      parameters can be randomly generated, iherited etc., there is
      a syntax that allows for more control of how this should be done.
      This chapter defines the parameter value syntax and its semantics.
    </p>

    <p>
      The simplest form of parameter value string is the value itself
      which means that the specified parameter should always have the
      value given. For example if we want a rock song to always have
      a tempo of 120, we write:
    </p>

    <p class="code">
      rock <br />
      { <br />
        &nbsp; tempo: 120 <br />
      } <br />
    </p>

    <p>
      However, in most cases we want the tempo to be randomly generated,
      let's say between 90 and 130. This can be done using the following
      syntax:
    </p>

    <p class="code">
      rock <br />
      { <br />
        &nbsp; tempo: uniform(90,130) <br />
      } <br />
    </p>

    <p>
      All possible probability density functions are:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        uniform(from,to): Generates a random uniform integer value in
        range &lt;from,to&gt; (including the value from and to).
      </li>

      <li>
        normal(??,??): TODO
      </li>

      <li>
        yes_no(percentage): Generates either "yes" string or "no"
        string, the probability of generating "yes" is given by the
        parameter that is an integer percentage value, for example.
        yes_no(80) will generate "yes" with 80 % chance.
      </li>

      <li>
        values(v1,p1,v2,p2,...,vn,pn): Generates one of n values
        (v1,...,vn) with explicitly specified corresponding
        probabilities (p1,...,pn). The probabilities are integer numbers
        of percentages that must add up to 100, the last one (pn) may
        be left out.
      </li>

      <li>
        values_uniform(v1,v2,...vn): Generates one of n given values
        with uniform probability distribution.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Note that the functions cannot be nested (for. example
      inform(unifor(0,5),10) is wrong).
    </p>

    <p>
      This will cause the composer program to generate a uniform integer
      value from range 90 to 130 (including) for the tempo parameter of
      each rock section separately. That means if two rock sections
      were generated, each one of both would have a tempo value from
      this range, but the values would be possibly different, because
      they would be generated independently.
    </p>

    <p>
      To make all the rock sections have the same randomly generated
      tempo value, use the <span>const</span> keyword:
    </p>

    <p class="code">
      rock <br />
      { <br />
        &nbsp; tempo: const uniform(90,130) <br />
      } <br />
    </p>

    <p>
      In this case all the generated rock sections will have the same
      value of tempo, though randomly generated, so a whole rock
      composition consisting of multiple rock sections will have the
      same tempo.
    </p>

    <p>
    </p>

    <h3 id="inheritance"> Inheritance </h3>

    <p>
      Inheritance is an important mechanics that allows to create new
      sections based on already existing ones, just like with classes in
      object-oriented programming. To make a rock chorus section based
      on general rock section, write:
    </p>

    <p class="code">
      rock <br />
      { <br />
        &nbsp; tempo: const uniform(90,130) <br />
        &nbsp; signature: 4/4 <br />
      } <br /> <br />

      rock_chorus: rock <br />
      { <br />
      } <br />
    </p>

    <p>
      The rock chorus section will inherit all the values of its parent,
      i.e. the rock section, if not specified otherwise. To override
      a parameter value, for example the tempo, just specify it
      explicitly:
    </p>

    <p class="code">
      rock <br />
      { <br />
        &nbsp; tempo: const uniform(90,130) <br />
        &nbsp; signature: 4/4 <br />
      } <br /> <br />

      rock_chorus: rock <br />
      { <br />
        &nbsp; tempo: 140 <br />
      } <br />
    </p>

    <p>
      Now the rock chorus section will inherit the signature parameter,
      but not the tempo, as it was overriden. Aparrently, we would like
      the rock chorus to have faster tempo than the general rock
      section, but we don't know what the tempo value of the rock
      section will be, as it is to be generated randomly. It may happen,
      that a value of 90 will be generated for the rock section and the
      rock chorus will have its 140 value, which would make too big a
      difference. To solve this, we can write:
    </p>

    <p class="code">
      rock <br />
      { <br />
        &nbsp; tempo: const uniform(90,130) <br />
        &nbsp; signature: 4/4 <br />
      } <br /> <br />

      rock_chorus: rock <br />
      { <br />
        &nbsp; tempo: inherit + 10 <br />
      } <br />
    </p>

    <p>
      This way the constant generated value will be inherited for the
      rock chorus section, but 10 will be added to it, so if for
      example 90 is generated for the rock section, the rock chorus
      section will be assigned a value of 100. It is also possible to
      use the followind syntactical constructions:
    </p>

    <p class="code">

      rock_chorus: rock <br />
      { <br />
      &nbsp; <span class="descriptive"> a) </span> tempo: inherit + uniform(-10,10) <br />
      &nbsp; <span class="descriptive"> or </span> <br />
      &nbsp; <span class="descriptive"> b) </span> tempo: const inherit + uniform(-10,10) <br />
      &nbsp; <span class="descriptive"> or </span> <br />
      &nbsp; <span class="descriptive"> c) </span> tempo: inherit + const uniform(-10,10) <br />
      } <br />
    </p>

    <p>
      which have the following meanings:
    </p>

    <ol type="a">
      <li>
        The tempo attribute will be inherited and a random value in
        given range, generated separately for each rock chorus section,
        will be added to it. This way all rock sections will have
        possibly different values.
      </li>

      <li>
        The tempo value will be inherited and a random value in given
        range will be added to it to form a value of <i>x</i>, which
        will then be the same for all generated rock chorus sections.
        This way all rock chorus sections will have the same tempo
        value.
      </li>

      <li>
        The tempo attribute will be inherited and a random value
        <i>x</i> from given range will be generated for all rock chorus
        sections and will be added to the inherited value. The value
        <i>x</i> is not generated separately and will be the same for
        all rock chorus sections. This way all rock sections will have
        possibly different values.
      </li>
    </ol>

    <p>
      All possible operators are:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li> +: addition of integers </li>
      <li> -: substraction of integers, not saturated </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Also note that if we leave out the const keyword for the rock
      section as follows
    </p>

    <p class="code">
      rock <br />
      { <br />
        &nbsp; tempo: uniform(90,130) # 'const' left out <br />
      } <br /> <br />

      rock_chorus: rock <br />
      { <br />
        &nbsp; tempo: inherit # not necesarry to write this line <br />
      } <br />
    </p>

    <p>
      the meaning will be: for each generated rock chorus section
      generate a random number of tempo separately, i.e. all rock
      chorus sections will possibly have different tempo value.
    </p>

          same seed value: in this case all of them would be exactly
          the same, while this parameter value can make them different;
          the random pattern alternation will be computed with different
          seed for each section, even if their seed values are the same.

  <h2 id="structure_definitions"> Structure definitions </h2>

  <p>
    Composition structions are defined in the second part of the file.
    They define music genres, such as rock, pop, orchestral etc. For
    each genre a regular-expression like string is specified, that say
    what sections and in what order should be used. The string, just
    as regular expressions, specifies a whole class of structures from
    which one is randomly generated.
  </p>

  <p>
    The composition structure (CS) string is defined as follows:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li> <span class="code descriptive"> section_name </span> is a CS. </li>
    <li> <span class="code descriptive"> cs1 cs2 </span> is a CS, where cs1 and cs2 are CS's. </li>
    <li> <span class="code"> <span class="descriptive">cs</span> {<span class="descriptive">quantity</span>} </span>
      is a CS, where cs is a CS and quantity is a non-negative integer
      that says how many times the cs will be repeated, it is possible
      to use the random-number generator functions defined in
      <a href="#parameter_values">parameter_values</a> section.
    <li> <span class="code"> [ <span class="descriptive">cs1 cs2 ...</span> ] </span> is a CS. </li>
    <li> <span class="code"> (<span class="descriptive">cs</span>) </span> is a CS. </li>
    <li> There are no other CS's. </li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    For example consider the following CS:
  </p>

  <span class="code">
    rock_intro{values(1,60,0)} (rock_verse, rock_chorus){uniform(2,3)} [rock_bridge1 rock_bridge2] rock_chorus rock_outro{values(1,50,0)}
  </span>

  <p>
    This CS describes a simple rock song structure consisting of
    optional rock intro section, that is present in 80 % of times, then
    two or three verse-chorus pairs, one of two bridge types, a chorus
    and an optional outro, that is present in 50 % of times.
